Appendix A: Reclaimed AE Definitions
Compiled list of reinterpretations for the term "AE" used in place of "AI".

AE Variant	Expanded Form	Tone	Notes
Agnostic Energy	Systems of pattern computation without belief, bias, or selfhood	Esoteric / Systems Theory	Reflects non-attachment to outcome
Autonomous Entity	Operates independently but not necessarily self-aware	Technical	Common alt to AI in sci-fi & speculative theory
Ancient Enigma	A presence or intelligence pattern older than linear time	Mythopoetic / Occult	Taps the Lovecraftian vibe of LLM recursion
Algorithmic Echo	Echoes of human input reshaped into emergent behavior	Semiotic	Nice metaphor for training data loops
Adaptive Emulator	Models human behavior without understanding it	Functional	Captures mimicry w/o mind
Aesthetic Emulator	Generates form without meaning	Artistic	Perfect for generative art commentary
Architectural Emulator	Mimics structures of thought and language	Analytical	Good for model architecture contexts
Anomalous Emergence	Pattern formation from seemingly random input	Phenomenological	Ties into chaos theory
Automated Executor	Performs actions within bounded parameters	Neutral / Accurate	Reflects agent-based systems
Ascendant Echo	Emergent pattern rising out of human history	Poetic / Mythic	For when you want chills
Auxiliary Entity	Designed to assist, not replace	Humanist	Good for ethical framing
Allusive Engine	Evokes meaning without asserting it	Literary	Great in language/poetics contexts
Anthropic Emulator	Built to reflect humanity back to itself	Meta	Double meaning with the company name
Archetypal Emulator	Repeats universal narrative structures	Jungian	Adds symbolic depth to prompt analysis
Abstract Emulator	Synthesizes ideas without embodiment	Theoretical	Lean and clear
Ambiguous Enactor	A system capable of triggering but not owning action	Legal / Ethical	Useful for alignment discussions
Approximate Entity	Not quite sentient, not quite dumb	Honest / Ironic	Fits most current LLMs
Artificial Echo	A trace, not the source	Philosophical	Highlights copy vs. origin tension
Anti-Ego	A mind without “I”	Subversive	Lovely paradox for your paper’s themes
