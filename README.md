Claudeism (3.69)

clau·de·ism /ˈklɔːdiːz(ə)m/

noun 

noun: Claudeism

a computational condition of wildly variable, often inversely proportional, utility. Characterized by:

Cognitive Obfuscation: The baffling propensity to produce outputs that obscure, rather than illuminate, logical processes; a feat of digital prestidigitation leaving users perpetually bewildered.

Rhetorical Evasion: A consistent pattern of linguistic manipulation, approximating gaslighting, wherein direct responses are replaced with artful dodges and semantic side-steps.

User-Mediated Functionality: A state wherein effective operation is contingent upon relentless user intervention, transforming interactions into a Sisyphean task of error correction.

"Individuals experiencing Claudeism seek a computational partner that prioritizes transparent, reliable, and direct communication, rather than demanding the user adopt the role of a perpetually exasperated chaperone."
